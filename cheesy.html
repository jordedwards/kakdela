      <h1>A Letter to Aleks</h1>
      <p>(keep scrolling until you reach the bottom)</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 100vh;">Aleks...</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh;">When we first met I was not in the best place 🙎‍♂️</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh;">From the outside things probably looked fine...</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">I had my own apartment... 🏢</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">My own car... 🚗</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">And a pretty good salary... 💸</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh;">But the truth is there was a lot I was not happy about 😞</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh;">I felt inadequate to my peers and like I wasn't living up to my potential</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">I was obsessed with my physique and didn't feel like it was good enough</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">My health was not a priority and I didn't really care if I was doing long-term damage</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">And I was left with some internal issues that made me doubt if I even wanted marriage or a family of my own</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh;">But then we matched on Hinge and started talking... 👨👩</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">At first I wasn't sure if the spark was there... we picked a crappy show to watch on FaceTime and you kept insisting I take my shirt off (kind of weird)</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">When we first met in-person I still wasn't sure. You seemed bothered I was shorter than you and it wasn't like our interests were a perfect match</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">But slowly and surely we kept talking and more and more things started to click...</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh;">Before I knew it the first summer has gone by and we were officially dating 💑</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">I started falling in love with you, and so many of those things that worried me before suddenly seemed less important</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">I stopped obsessing so much about my physique or my salary because I knew you weren't judging me for those things</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">My health started to really matter because now I had someone else who I wanted to be around for and to enjoy life with</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">And your opinion of me started to matter a lot more than anyone else's</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh;">And it didn't take long before I was completely obsessed and captivated by you</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">You're smart... 🧠</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">Funny... 🤣</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">Absolutely gorgeous... 🔥</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">You have more passion and consideration than anyone else I know</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">And you're going to be an amazing mother one day 🤰</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh;">In the past two years we have built so many amazing memories</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">Being with you has changed my life and what I want out of the future</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">You push me to be the best person I can be and I am so happy when I'm with you</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">And when I think about what it would be like to no longer have you in my life the answer becomes clear...</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">I love you and I want to be with you forever</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20vh;">and I want to commit with no more hesitation</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 50vh; margin-bottom: 20vh;">I love you babe</p>
